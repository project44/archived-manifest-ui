<p align="center">Design System themes and components for <a href="https://www.project44.com/">project44</a>.</p>

Themeable design system built using [Emotion] and [Radix] for project44.

## Documentation

Our documentation site lives at [p44design.systems]. You'll be able to find detailed documentation on getting started, all of the components, our theme, our principles, and more.

## Installation

Install `@manifest-ui/react` and necessary peer dependencies in your project with your package manager of choice:

```sh
# with npm
npm install @manifest-ui/react

# with yarn
yarn add @manifest-ui/react
```

All Manifest UI packages can be found on [NPM].

## Usage

To start using the theme and components, please follow these steps:

Wrap your application with the `Provider` provided by **@manifest-ui/react**.

```jsx
import { Provider } from '@manifest-ui/react';

// Do this at the root of your application
function App({ children }) {
  return <Provider>{children}</Provider>;
}
```

Now you can start using components like so:

```jsx
import { Button } from '@manifest-ui/react';

function Example() {
  return <Button>Track shipment</Button>;
}
```
